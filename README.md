States and how they affect each other

## Getting Started

The Project Segmentation

Zharlaw has created all functionality based on the task delivarables and it was evident in:
https://github.com/neyneyhoe/MAD3-Submission-2---Calimpon-Tumamak 

To improve the UI and functionality, this is the modifed and additional changes:
1. Setting text theme using fig tree in Google and limit the posts to 3 entries only to have better control of posts.
2. Modified Summary Card to allow viewing of newly added post. The previous code do not allow this and might encounter errors.
3. Added Add and Edit screens, the screens is a better approach than modals.
4. Modified Add functionality to allow seamless creation of new post with getPost(). The getPost() functionality gets a new post from:
"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/" and the new post is added to the list of posts. But it's title and body is updated to cater
the desired title and body of user.
5. Created Edit and Delete functionality, edit and delete functionality already exist in Zhar's code. But this version caters the need of
the Edit Screen and the Delete button.


Reason of having two versions:
1. Zharlaw finished his tasks from 1-3 but I failed to communicate that I am doing my tasks. To ensure his grades won't get affected of my
submission, he created the other functionalities and submitted it on time.
2. I am sick since Friday and I went to church, then it got worsen on Saturday night. I woke up late Sunday and rushed to create my tasks.
Thus, we decided that I will create my own version to not affect the submitted files for the initial repository was submitted on time.
